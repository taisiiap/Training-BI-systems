# Creating a custom event dashboard for a news aggregator

## Task:
Using Yandex.Zen data to build a dashboard with metrics of user interaction with article cards

## Description:
I worked on this project on a remote machine in the Yandex.Cloud service. I installed PostgreSQL and deployed a database. Then I wrote a pipeline script that allowed me to collect data for a certain time period, and set it up to work offline through crontab. To visualize the collected data, I wrote a dashboard script with several filters and also ran it on a remote machine. Based on the results, a presentation was prepared with the resulting graphs
