# Creating a custom event dashboard for a news aggregator

## Task:
Using Yandex.Zen data to build a dashboard with metrics of user interaction with article cards

## Description:
I worked on this project on a remote machine in the Yandex.Cloud service. I installed PostgreSQL and deployed a database. Then I wrote a pipeline script that allowed me to collect data for a certain time period, and set it up to work offline through crontab. To visualize the collected data, I wrote a dashboard script with several filters and also ran it on a remote machine. Based on the results, a presentation was prepared with the resulting graphs

## Results:
The dashboards by means of filters and interactive praphs helps to answer the following questions in real time:
 - the number of actions in each topic (top-10 topics by actions from users). The graph also shows the period of activity
 - the number of themes genereated by the source topics.  10.7% of themes are generated by cards "Family relations"
 - how crad topics correlaet with source topics. source topic "Traveling" generates "Stories" mostly. Blanks mean that the source doesn't generate such topics, for example there are no topics about female phsycology in a source topic "Construction".
