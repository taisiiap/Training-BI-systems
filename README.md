| [custom event dashboard for a news aggregator](https://github.com/taisiiap/Training-BI-systems/tree/main/Tableau%20Public) | I worked on this project on a remote machine in the Yandex.Cloud service. I installed PostgreSQL and deployed a database. Then I wrote a pipeline script that allowed me to collect data for a certain time period, and set it up to work offline through crontab. To visualize the collected data, I wrote a dashboard script with several filters and also ran it on a remote machine. Based on the results, a presentation was prepared with the resulting graphs | *Tableau* |
| [informative dashboard for the general manager of sausage factory](https://github.com/taisiiap/Training-BI-systems/tree/main/Power-BI) | To visualize the data in I wrote a dashboard script with several filters. There are made two tabs: the first one with a general review of a world sousage market, including import and export of products. The secong one shows internal market and it's metrics | *Power BI* |
