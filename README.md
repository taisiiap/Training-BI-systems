| [Creating a custom event dashboard for a news aggregator](https://github.com/taisiiap/Training-BI-systems/tree/main/Tableau%20Public) | I worked on this project on a remote machine in the Yandex.Cloud service. I installed PostgreSQL and deployed a database. Then I wrote a pipeline script that allowed me to collect data for a certain time period, and set it up to work offline through crontab. To visualize the collected data, I wrote a dashboard script with several filters and also ran it on a remote machine. Based on the results, a presentation was prepared with the resulting graphs | *Tableau* |
| [Building an informative dashboard, in the style of a journalistic research about the market of sausages and sausage products](https://github.com/taisiiap/Training-BI-systems/tree/main/Power-BI) | I made two tabs: first with a General review of world market, including import and wxport data. The secong tab shows internal market and it's metrics | *Power BI* |
